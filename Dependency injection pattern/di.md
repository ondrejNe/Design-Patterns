# Dependency injection pattern

Dependency Injection (DI) is a software design pattern that enables the separation of concerns between components of an application. It provides a way to invert the flow of control and decouple components by allowing dependencies to be passed in rather than created within a class. In other words, DI is a technique for providing the dependencies that an object needs to function, rather than having the object create those dependencies itself.

The DI pattern consists of three main components: the client class (or consumer), the service class (or provider), and the injector. The client class is the component that uses the service class, and the injector is responsible for creating and providing the service class instance to the client.

There are three common types of dependency injection:

- Constructor Injection: In this type of DI, the dependencies are passed to the constructor of the client class. This allows the client class to be created with all the dependencies it needs to function.

- Property Injection: In this type of DI, the dependencies are set as properties of the client class after it has been created. This allows for more flexibility in adding or changing dependencies at runtime.

- Method Injection: In this type of DI, the dependencies are passed to specific methods of the client class as arguments. This allows for even more flexibility in adding or changing dependencies at runtime.

The benefits of using DI include:

- Increased testability: By using DI, it becomes easier to write unit tests for each component in isolation, as dependencies can be mocked or stubbed out.

- Reduced coupling: By using DI, components are not tightly coupled to one another, making it easier to modify, extend, or replace parts of the application.

- Improved modularity: By using DI, the application can be divided into smaller, more manageable components, making it easier to understand and maintain.

- Increased flexibility: By using DI, components can be easily reconfigured or swapped out without affecting the rest of the application.

DI is commonly used in modern web frameworks such as Spring for Java, ASP.NET Core for .NET, and Angular for JavaScript, to manage dependencies between components of an application.

# Example

Let's consider an example of a Python application that uses the Dependency Injection pattern. In this example, we'll create a `UserService` class that depends on a `UserRepository` class to provide user data. Instead of creating a new `UserRepository` instance within the `UserService`, we'll use Dependency Injection to pass a `UserRepository` instance to the `UserService` constructor.

```py
class User:
    def __init__(self, id, name, email):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email


class UserRepository:
    def get_user(self, id):
        # Retrieve user data from a database or other data store
        return User(id, 'John Doe', 'john.doe@example.com')


class UserService:
    def __init__(self, user_repository):
        self.user_repository = user_repository

    def get_user(self, id):
        return self.user_repository.get_user(id)
```

In this example, the `User` class represents a user object with an id, name, and email. The `UserRepository` class provides methods for retrieving user data from a data store. The `UserService` class is the client class that depends on the `UserRepository` class to provide user data.

To use the Dependency Injection pattern, we'll create an instance of the `UserRepository` class and pass it to the `UserService` constructor:

```py
userRepository = UserRepository()
userService = UserService(user_repository=userRepository)

user = userService.get_user(1)
print(user.name)
```

In this example, we've created an instance of the `UserRepository` class and passed it to the `UserService` constructor using the `user_repository` argument. We then use the `UserService` to retrieve user data for a specific id and print the user's name.

By using Dependency Injection, we've separated the concerns of creating and managing the `UserRepository` instance from the `UserService` class. This makes it easier to modify or extend the application, as we can easily swap out the `UserRepository` instance with a different implementation or mock object for testing purposes. Additionally, by passing the `UserRepository` instance to the `UserService` constructor, we've made it clear that the `UserService`depends on the `UserRepository`, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
