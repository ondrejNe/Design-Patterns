# Unit of Work pattern
The Unit of Work (UoW) design pattern is a commonly used software design pattern that provides an abstraction layer over the data access layer of an application. The UoW pattern is used to manage a set of related database operations as a single unit of work, ensuring that all operations either succeed or fail as a single transaction.

In the UoW pattern, the unit of work is an object that keeps track of all changes made to the application's data during a transaction. The UoW object is responsible for managing the transaction and coordinating the persistence of changes to the underlying data store. The UoW object provides a simple, consistent interface for the application to interact with, hiding the complexity of the underlying data access layer.

The benefits of using the UoW pattern include:

- Consistency: The UoW pattern ensures that all changes made during a transaction are persisted as a single unit of work, ensuring consistency of data.

- Atomicity: The UoW pattern ensures that either all changes made during a transaction are persisted, or none are persisted, ensuring atomicity of data.

- Isolation: The UoW pattern ensures that changes made during a transaction are not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed, ensuring isolation of data.

- Maintainability: The UoW pattern provides a clear separation of concerns between the application logic and the data access layer, making the code easier to maintain and modify.

The UoW pattern is commonly used in modern applications built with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks such as Hibernate for Java or Entity Framework for .NET.

# Example

Let's consider an example of an e-commerce application that needs to manage orders and products. In this example, we'll use the Unit of Work design pattern to manage a set of related database operations as a single unit of work.

First, we'll create a `Product` class to represent a product:
```py
class Product:
    def __init__(self, id, name, price):
        self.id = id
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
```

Next, we'll create an Order class to represent an order:
```py
class Order:
    def __init__(self, id, product_id, quantity):
        self.id = id
        self.product_id = product_id
        self.quantity = quantity
```

Now, we'll create a `UnitOfWork` class to manage a set of related database operations as a single unit of work:
```py
class UnitOfWork:
    def __init__(self, connection):
        self.connection = connection
        self.products = []
        self.orders = []

    def add_product(self, product):
        self.products.append(product)

    def add_order(self, order):
        self.orders.append(order)

    def commit(self):
        cursor = self.connection.cursor()

        try:
            cursor.execute("BEGIN")

            for product in self.products:
                cursor.execute("INSERT INTO products (id, name, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (product.id, product.name, product.price))

            for order in self.orders:
                cursor.execute("INSERT INTO orders (id, product_id, quantity) VALUES (?, ?, ?)", (order.id, order.product_id, order.quantity))

            cursor.execute("COMMIT")

        except:
            cursor.execute("ROLLBACK")
            raise

        finally:
            cursor.close()
```
In this example, the `UnitOfWork` class manages a set of related database operations for adding products and orders. The add_product and add_order methods add new `Product`and `Order` bjects to their respective collections. The `commit` method starts a new transaction, executes the necessary database operations, and either commits the transaction if all operations succeed or rolls back the transaction if any operation fails.

Finally, in the business logic layer, we'll use the `UnitOfWork` class to manage a set of related database operations:
```py
connection = # create database connection

unitOfWork = UnitOfWork(connection)

try:
    product = Product(1, 'Widget', 9.99)
    unitOfWork.add_product(product)

    order = Order(1, 1, 2)
    unitOfWork.add_order(order)

    unitOfWork.commit()

except:
    print('Error: Transaction rolled back.')

finally:
    connection.close()
```

By using the Unit of Work pattern, we've managed a set of related database operations as a single unit of work, ensuring consistency, atomicity, and isolation of data. If any operation fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, ensuring that the data remains consistent. This pattern is commonly used in modern web applications to manage database transactions, ensuring the integrity of the data.
